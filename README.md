This project involves building a language identification model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. By leveraging the pre-trained papluca/xlm-roberta-base-language-detection model, the system can accurately detect the language of given text inputs. The project covers setting up the environment, loading the model, and performing text classification tasks. The model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying languages such as English, Spanish, French, and German. This solution is useful for applications requiring automated language detection, enhancing multilingual support in various software systems.
